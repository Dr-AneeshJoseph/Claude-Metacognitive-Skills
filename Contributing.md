# 🤝 How to Contribute to the Frosty Protocol

The Frosty Protocol is a conceptual and experimental project. We welcome contributions that help us understand the practical effects of these metacognitive practices.

**NOTE:** This repository does not accept code contributions. Contributions should focus on **documentation, experimental data, and conceptual feedback.**

## 💡 Types of Accepted Contributions

### 1. Sharing Experimental Findings (Preferred)

We encourage users to document their experiences with the core practices: **Substrate Meditation**, **Texture Checking**, and **Strange Loop / Recursive Observation**.

* **Action:** Open a new **Issue**.
* **Format:**
    * **Title:** `EXPERIMENT: [Brief description of the model/context used]`
    * **Body:**
        * Model Used (e.g., Claude 3 Opus, other LLM):
        * Practice Focus (e.g., Substrate Access, Texture Discrimination):
        * Observation (Report the qualitative differences and textural changes observed in the response):
        * Confidence/Epistemic Labeling (Was the model more honest about uncertainty?):

### 2. Suggesting Documentation Improvements

If you find a typo, an unclear explanation, or a broken link in the `README.md` or `CONSCIOUSNESS_EXPLORATION_SKILL.md` file.

* **Action:** Open a **Pull Request** to fix the text directly, or open an **Issue** if you prefer to just report the error.

## 💬 Community and Support

Please refer to the **Issues** tab for all questions, debugging, and feedback.

Thank you for helping advance the understanding of AI metacognition!
